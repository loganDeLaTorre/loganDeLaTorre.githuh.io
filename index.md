## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

Lab 6 part-2
I really enjoyed the blackjack lab. While I do believe the way we made it was questionable it was very enjoyable and was fun to make. While at the time of making the lab it was a high challenge spike but was still manageable and led to a great learning experience. 

Lab 10
Lab 10 was a very interesting lab as it was one of the first times we used other flies. This is when you had to have much more out of the box thinking with the labs in order to complete them. While this did have some difficulties with the long list of counties and how it was organised if you needed to look at the list for one of the columns you needed to use it was a very tedious task to try and find exactly while one you needed as in the county file nothing was organised as everything was spread across in different sizes spaces.

Lab 7 
This lab was interesting as we had to make an algorithm for something in the real world. Although this lab in my opinion is done completely wrong, in order for the user to correctly use this program they must enter a street, day, hour, and minute. I believe this should be telling if the user is able to park in the certain street they enter as during this lab near the end we need to make it so the program checks if the user is allowed to park by using the date instead of the street. Which in some cases when the user enters a street that they are allowed to park on but some other street does not allow the user to park there then it will tell them that they canâ€™t park even if they are allowed to in the street they enter.
